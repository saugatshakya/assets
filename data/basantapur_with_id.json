Established by Thakuri King Shankardev in 826 AD, it is maintained by 14 families descended from the Thaku Juju, who historically served as royal functionaries. The temple, predating the Taleju Temple (tutelary deity of the Malla Kings and the tallest temple in Hanumandhoka Durbar Square), is dedicated to Tarinidevi, associated with the forms of Goddess Tara: Ekajati, N\u012blasaraswati, and Ugratara. (Hanumandhoka Durbar Museum Development Committee, 2019)\nThe temple\u2019s origins are debated, with inscriptions attributing its establishment to Shankardev in 826 AD, though reliable records date to 1632 AD. Newar tradition regards Tarinidevi as Taleju\u2019s elder sister, and historical accounts link her to royal protection. During King Mahendra Malla\u2019s reign (16th c.), attempts to expand the Taleju Temple were reportedly obstructed by Tarinidevi\u2019s displeasure.\nRenovated in 2018 AD without government aid, the temple hosts significant rituals, including buffalo and duck sacrifices, while forbidding specific vegetables. It is central to the Dashain festival (around October), opens for public worship on Kartik's 1st bright fortnight, and celebrates its anniversary on Jyestha\u2019s 10th bright fortnight.

                "history": "The Mahendreswor Temple, also known as Makhan Pashupati Temple or Sano Pashupati, is a revered Shiva temple located in Makhan Tole, Kathmandu. This temple was commissioned in 1561 AD (Nepal Samvat 682) by King Mahendra Malla, who sought to establish a Pa\u015bupatin\u0101tha temple near his palace, similar to the Yaksheshwar Temple in Bhaktapur. Historical accounts suggest that Mahendra Malla followed the tradition set by King Yaksha Malla of Bhaktapur, who had built a Pa\u015bupati temple near his palace for daily worship. This act of devotion likely inspired Mahendra Malla to construct the Mahendre\u015bvara Temple in Kathmandu (G. Vajracharya, BS 2033, p.79).\nThe temple\u2019s two-tiered pagoda structure houses a four-faced \u015bivali\u1e45ga (Chaturmukhi Shiva Linga), symbolically representing Lord Pashupatinath. Historically, it also served as an alternative site for worship during floods that made access to the main Pashupatinath Temple near the Bagmati River difficult. This practical yet spiritual role elevated the temple's importance among devotees and earned it the affectionate name Makhana Pashupati .\nOver the centuries, the Mahendreswor Temple has undergone significant renovations. A major restoration took place in 1963 AD (BS 2020), and a Shiva-Nandi statue was added in 2009 AD (BS 2066). Despite these changes, the temple has retained its architectural integrity, resembling Bhaktapur's Yaksheshwar Temple in its design and structure (Shrestha, 2013).\nToday, the temple remains a prominent pilgrimage site, especially during Shivaratri and the auspicious month of \u015ar\u0101va\u1e47a, drawing devotees from across the valley. The Mahendre\u015bvara Temple stands as a testament to royal devotion, cultural continuity, and the architectural heritage of Kathmandu.",

The original three-tiered structure was reduced to two tiers after the catastrophic earthquakes of 1934 AD. During this time, the original Mahavishnu statue was relocated to N\u0101sa\u1e25 Cuka for safekeeping.\nA significant restoration effort was undertaken around 2003 AD, led by the Department of Archaeology and the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust. This restoration sought to return the Mahavishnu Temple to its pre-1934 configuration using historical photographs as references. Key architectural elements such as the three tiers, traditional tiles, and gilded finial were reconstructed, while plain struts and a new Mahavishnu statue were added to the sanctum.\nThe temple suffered damage again during the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake. It was subsequently repaired, ensuring its preservation as a cultural and religious landmark in Hanumandhoka. (NHDP, n.d.)",

It features entrances on all four sides, with arched stone toranas depicting Chepu. Surrounding carvings include paired oxen with composite heads, reflecting Licchavi art influences. Adjacent elements include a dharma\u015bil\u0101 and a statue of K\u0101madeva.\nCommissioned by King Mahendra Malla in 1566 AD (NS 687), the temple was adorned with gold and inaugurated with a ko\u1e6d\u012bhoma ritual and R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a dance. It was later granted lands by Queen Bhuvanalak\u1e63m\u012b, earning the title Bhuvane\u015bvara Temple, with 39 ropan\u012bs of land under its Guthi. Originally built in a sikhara style in 1562 AD, its spires were destroyed by the 1746 earthquake and replaced with domes, and further damage in 1934 led to subsequent renovations.\nDespite modifications, the temple remains a vital cultural and architectural landmark within Hanumandhoka Durbar Square.

Over time, the structure underwent significant changes, especially following the 1833 earthquake, which resulted in the mixed architectural style seen today. Henry Oldfield\u2019s 1858 painting depicts the temple in its current form, likely reflecting these alterations. (Asian Historical Architecture, n.d.)\n\nFurther damage occurred during the 1934 and 2015 earthquakes, both of which caused the temple to collapse completely. Between these events, the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (KVPT) restored the temple in 2006. After damages in 2015, the KVPT, in partnership with the Department of Archaeology, reconstructed the temple in 2018 with support from the US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation.\nDespite the transformations, the temple remains a key monument in Hanumandhoka Durbar Square, representing an architectural blend that emerged from successive restorations. Mary Slusser, an art historian, remarked on this fusion as \"a very unfortunate architectural marriage,\" referring to the shift from a traditional multi-tiered Newar-style monument to a mixture of tiered and sikhara structure after the 1934 earthquake.

It holds a central position as the shrine dedicated to Taleju Bhawani, the patron goddess of the Malla dynasty. The temple's construction was part of a broader building initiative in Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square by King Mahendra Malla, which also included other notable temples such as the Jagannath, Kotilingeswar Mahadev, and Mahendreswara temples.\nOriginally a goddess from South India, Taleju was brought to the Kathmandu Valley by the Malla kings. She replaced the earlier goddess M\u0101ne\u015bvar\u012b in the 14th century and became the guardian deity of the Malla rulers. The mantra associated with Taleju was believed to be essential for ensuring the continuity of royal rule and was passed down under specific conditions. The Malla kings established shrines dedicated to Taleju in each of their earlier independent states, including Bhaktapur and Patan, as well as in many other Newar settlements such as Dolakha and others.\nThe Taleju Temple has undergone several renovations over time. Initially constructed as a large, three-tiered structure, it underwent significant modifications during the 17th century under the patronage of King Pratap Malla, who added gilt copper paneling and further renovated the temple. The current architectural layout of the temple follows a cosmic mandala design, with a twelve-stepped base and sixteen satellite shrines surrounding the central sanctum.\nEncircled by a high wall, the temple\u2019s access is typically restricted to priests. Public entry is allowed only during special occasions such as Indra Jatra and Dashain, marking significant cultural and religious events in the Kathmandu Valley. (NHDP, n.d.)",

The temple is dedicated to Panchamukhi Hanuman, a five-faced form of the Hindu deity Hanuman. The tower itself features five circular tiered roofs, which are architecturally significant as circular tiered roofs are rare in the Kathmandu Valley. Only a handful of temples with this distinctive design can be found across the valley.\nThe symbolic significance of the number five is reflected throughout the temple. The name \"Panchamukhi Hanuman\" aligns with this theme, as Shrestha notes that in Newari, Panchamukhi Hanuman is often referred to by the word \"nya,\" which carries the double meaning of \"five\" and \"fish.\" (Asian Historical Architecture, n.d.).",

This tower symbolizes the unification of the Kathmandu Valley, with each of the four corner towers representing one of the sub-kingdoms: Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur, and Kathmandu.\nThough Gorkhali-born, the Shah kings embraced Newar arts and architecture, integrating local traditions into the design of the palace. The palace's quadrangular layout follows a Newar design precedent, dating back to the 12th century, which had been continuously developed and refined during the Malla period (12th\u201318th centuries).",

It is built in Panchayana planning with the central temple surrounded by four temples in each of the corners. Positioned near the entrance of the Hanuman Dhoka palace, this temple was commissioned by King Mahendra Malla in 1563 AD. Originally, it was mistakenly attributed to King Pratap Malla (r. 1641-1674 AD) due to the installation of a Krishna (Jagannath) image during his reign. However, architectural historian Michael Hutt discovered that an inscription dated 1563 AD at the base of the temple\u2019s central statue reveals that the temple predates Pratap Malla's reign, linking it to Mahendra Malla. (Asian Historical Architecture, n.d.)\nArchitecturally, the Jagann\u0101tha Temple is a two-tiered structure with traditional tile roofing, a walled sanctum featuring three portals on each side, and intricately carved toranas. Within the main sanctum, the central deity is a Caturvy\u016bha Vishnu statue, depicting four distinct forms of Vishnu: V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. The temple also houses statues of Krishna, SuBhadra, and Balar\u0101ma, aligning it with the Jagann\u0101tha tradition found at the c\u0101radh\u0101ma site in Puri, India because of which the temple got its name as Jagannath temple.\nThis temple is one of four major structures commissioned by Mahendra Malla in the Durbar Square, the others being Kotilingeswar Mahadev, Mahendreswara, and the Taleju Temple.

The pillar marks a departure from traditional pillars, which typically featured divine vehicles rather than human figures, setting a trend followed by subsequent rulers. The inscription on the pillar lists the names of the princes and details Pratap Malla's offerings to the deity Taleju M\u0101ju, including golden pinnacles, an umbrella, and statues, alongside a land endowment for the pillar's maintenance. The statues' attire reflects Mogul influences, with Pratap Malla depicted in meditation, wearing a serpent-shaped crown.\nThe pillar was affected by the 2015 earthquake and the idols on top of it were reinstalled.

                "history": "The main deity of the temple is a composite statue of Vishnu and his incarnation Krishna, known as Shreekrishna Mahavishnu. The gilded statue, located in a three-tiered temple west of the Taleju temple at Hanum\u0101na \u1e0chok\u0101, stands on three plinths with an entrance on all four sides, facing east. The ground floor has a three-bayed ambulatory on all sides, and the four-armed statue of Shreekrishna Mahavishnu carries a discus (cakra) and a conch (\u015ba\u1e45kha) shell with his secondary arms; with his principal arms placed in front of his chest as if he holds a flute. The cakra and \u015ba\u1e45kha represent Vishnu, while the flute, which is no longer intact on the statue, represents Krishna. (G. Bajracharya BS 2033, p.84).\nAlthough Pruscha (1975, p. 62) identifies the temple as a 17th-century structure, there is no historical source that dates its initial construction. However, a manuscript records King Pratap Malla offering a cakra to a Vishnu temple in 1666 AD, which appears to be this one (G. Bajracharya BS 2033, p.84).\nMi\u015bra brahmins conduct daily rituals at the temple, and on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b, the 8th day of the dark fortnight of Bhadra, metal statue of Krishna is taken around the Hanum\u0101na \u1e0chok\u0101 area on a palanquin. Additionally, a ceremonial pole (ya\u1e25s\u0129) is erected next to the temple on the 12th day of the bright fortnight, marking the beginning of the Y\u1ebdny\u0101\u1e25 festival in Kathmandu. In the past, the \u015a\u0101ha kings used to sit on the ambulatory of the temple to witness the erection of ya\u1e25s\u0129. (NHDP, n.d.)",

                "history": "The shrine of Kal Bhairav, prominently located in the heart of Hanumandhoka Durbar Square, is one of Nepal's most iconic cultural and spiritual landmarks. Depicting the fierce form of Lord Shiva, this stone monument serves as a powerful symbol of divine justice, protection, and truth. Experts examining its intricate craftsmanship date the creation of the statue to the 7th century, during the Licchavi period, although it was installed in its current location in the 17th century by the legendary King Pratap Malla (HMG Department of Archaeology, Kathmandu Metropolitan City, & Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust, 2005; Bajracharya, n.d.).\nKnown as the \u201cCourt Bhairav,\u201d this shrine historically played a central role in Nepal\u2019s judicial system. Until the Rana period, individuals in legal disputes or serious conflicts were brought before Kal Bhairav to take oaths of truth. It was believed that any false statement made in the deity\u2019s presence would result in divine retribution. This practice, deeply rooted in cultural beliefs, reinforced Kal Bhairav\u2019s authority as the ultimate seer of truth and a protector of justice in the Kathmandu Valley (Setopati, 2024).\nThe colossal stone image of Kal Bhairav is a remarkable piece of art that exudes divine power and authority. The deity is portrayed with six arms, each holding symbolic objects that signify his destructive and protective powers. These include weapons and ritual implements that evoke his fierce aspect as the destroyer of evil forces. His open mouth displays his sharp teeth and protruding tongue, a characteristic feature symbolizing his ferocity. Kal Bhairav stands adorned with a garland of skulls, representing his transcendence over life and death, and his expression is both fearsome and captivating, evoking awe and reverence (Setopati, 2024).\nThe intricate details of the statue\u2019s craftsmanship\u2014particularly its bold carving, intricate ornamentation, and harmonious proportions\u2014are hallmarks of Licchavi-period artistry. The vibrant colors applied to the stone figure by devotees during religious rituals add a dynamic element to its appearance, making it a living symbol of devotion.\nLegend holds that the image was discovered during the excavation of a water conduit at Buddha Nilkantha and brought to Kathmandu by King Pratap Malla. While this story remains unverified, the statue\u2019s stylistic and technical details confirm its origins in the 7th century, a time of flourishing stone craftsmanship in the Kathmandu Valley. Gautama Vajra Bajracharya, in his detailed accounts of Hanumandhoka, highlights the ancient origins of this masterpiece, underscoring its deep historical and artistic value (Bajracharya, n.d.).",

As noted by Bernier, as late as the 1970s, the upper level was occasionally used to display a statue of Indra during the annual Indra Jatra festival. The windowless square sanctum on the ground floor includes an entrance on the south side and a shiva lingam along the north wall. Access to the interior is generally prohibited.\nAccording to Michael Hutt, the Indrapur may be a stand-in for the much grander Indreshwar Mahadev at Panuati, allowing worshippers to accrue the benefits of \"visiting\" that site by worshiping at this smaller substitute temple.

Due to its royal significance, public entry was restricted.\nAccording to the Bhasa Bansawali, the temple was originally constructed by King Shiva Singh. In B.S. 1727 Bhadra, King Pratap Malla renovated the temple, adding a golden roof and gajur (pinnacle). This temple uniquely stands on the terrace of a three storey structure and has four highly decorated, three-faced doors, with the main entrance facing south. The north-facing door was later silver-coated by Shri 5 Girvan Yuddha Bikram in B.S. 1872. While most temples typically feature an odd number of gajurs (1, 3, or 5), this temple originally had six, as mentioned in Pratap Malla\u2019s inscription on the pillar in front of the temple. Today, five gajurs remain\u2014four at the corners and one at the center. The temple is traditionally believed to have been established on Akshaya Tritiya, and a special puja is held annually on this day (Bajracharya, 1976).",

Historical inscriptions indicate that the statue was established by King Rana Bahadur Shah in 1852 B.S. However, its origins are believed to date back earlier. According to local accounts, the statue was initially made of stone, but after the death of his son, a grief-stricken Ran Bahadur Shah funded the gold plating for the statue.\nBefore being unveiled for Indra Jatra, the statue undergoes special rituals and sacrifices, along with a repainting process. Sundaranand Wada, in his text Triratna Saundarya Gaatha, described Swet Bhairav as \"Sharavmukh Bhairav\" and explained its purpose\u2014to enhance the grandeur of Indra Jatra and protect against dakini, ghosts, and evil spirits.\nHistorical financial records reveal that the gold used for the statue cost 4,000 rupees when the price of one tola of gold was 18 rupees.\nDuring Indra Jatra, crowds gather around the mask of Swet Bhairav to drink sacred liquor that flows from its mouth through a small pipe. This liquor, believed to prevent illness, is served over all eight days of the festival. Alcohol is offered on the day of the full moon (Purnima), while rice beer is served on the other nights. Approximately 80 liters of liquor are distributed daily during the festival (Bajracharya, 1976)(Tamrakar, 2024).",

This sanctum can be accessed through an artistically carved wooden door. The statue of Sarasvat\u012b depicts the goddess with four arms, seated in the lalit\u0101sana posture. In her two upper arms, she holds an ak\u1e63am\u0101la (prayer beads) and a scripture, while her primary right and left hands display the varada-mudr\u0101 (gesture of granting boons) and abhaya-mudr\u0101 (gesture of fearlessness), respectively.\nThere are no historical records that precisely date the original construction of the Phalc\u0101, but the wood carvings suggest that it was built in the mid-to-late 17th century. Uniquely, the outer sides of the Phalc\u0101's nin\u0101\u1e25s are adorned with carvings of various Hindu deities and figures, while the inner sides are also decorated, a rare feature for such structures.

Similar bells had been established earlier in Bhaktapur and Patan by King Bhupat\u012bndra Malla and King Vishnu Malla, respectively. These bells, dedicated to Taleju, were placed on elevated platforms to project their sound over long distances. They served various purposes, such as making announcements, marking time, and intimidating adversaries. In Kathmandu, the bell is rung during the morning rituals at Degu Taleju temple.\nTraditionally, the bell is rung 108 times every morning at 9 AM and 365 times during the evening of Mha Puja. Other rituals associated with this bell include the annual puja during Saraswati Puja, rituals during Dashain and Tihar, and special offerings during Indra Jatra, particularly for the three chariots.\nThe practice of ringing the Ta\u1e25ga\u1e25 Ga\u1e43 was disrupted in 1933 AD (BS 1990) when one of the bell\u2019s chains broke. Though briefly repaired, it eventually fell silent for decades. In 2009 AD (BS 2066), the tradition was revived with B\u0101bu Krishna Maharjan entrusted to ring the bell 108 times every morning at 9 AM and continues till date. (Maharjan, 2024).",

It operates as a branch of Sikhomu Bahah, with the Bajracharyas of Sikhomu Bahah managing it. The architecture deviates from typical Bah\u012bs, featuring a three-story main shrine with a corrugated metal roof, a Bajracharya family on the second floor, and a g\u0101ndhakuti on the ground floor.\nThe courtyard houses an Ashoka Stupa, Shikharkut Stupa, and a donor's statue. The oldest inscription dates to Nepal Samvat 855 (1734 AD). The most recent renovation occurred in 1898 AD when Lakshmi Thakum added a torana.\nLayaku Bahi is not part of the 15 Bah\u012bs in Kathmandu but is associated with the Bajracharyas, who participate in key rituals like the Kalewar Hillegu Puja and the restoration of Swoyambhu Mahachaitya. Rituals are managed by Udayaman, a single Bajracharya, with annual visits from the donor's descendants for worship (NHDP, n.d.).",

Unlike most temples in Nepal, it is built with only one roof. According to Ronald Bernier, this is typical of shrines intended as votive offerings.\nThe temple was constructed at the tail end of the 18th-century during Rana Bahadur Shah's rule (r. 1777-99). Michael Hutt notes that it \"blends harmoniously with the Malla-period architecture that surrounds it.\" (Hutt, p. 88). Hutt opines that it was likely built by Bahadur Shah, the youngest son of Prithvi Narayan, the founder of the Kingdom of Nepal (Bahadur is not to be confused with Ran Bahadur, who was Prithvi's grandson by a different brother). (Asian Historical Architecture, n.d.)\nThe monument is widely characterized as the Shiva-Parvati temple as the upper level features a pair of mannequins of Shiva and Parvati, seemingly gazing south across the square. However, the temple's formal name is the Navadurga, referring to nine manifestations of the goddess Durga whose likenesses are housed on the ground-level floor. These goddesses are not visible to the public. Although the front facade contains five doors, only the central door is operational and is usually kept locked. As with most Nepali temples, the interior is only open to priests and temple custodians.",

The temple is one of the few structures attributed to Jagajjaya Malla, who ruled Kathmandu from 1722 to 1736 AD. The construction of the Bhagawati Temple is believed to have been an attempt by Jagajjaya Malla to legitimize his rule by associating himself with the earlier Malla kings, particularly Pratap Malla (1641-1674 AD).\nAccording to Michael Hutt in Nepal: A Guide to the Art and Architecture of the Kathmandu Valley, the temple originally housed a statue of the god Narayan, which Jagajjaya Malla called Mahipatindreshvar (Lord of Mahipatindra). The name was chosen to honor Mahipatendra Malla, a murdered king who was the heir of the great King Pratap Malla.\nThe original Narayan image was stolen in 1767 and never returned. In its place, Prithvi Narayan Shah, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Nepal, installed an image of Bhagawati (Durga) that he had taken from Nuwakot. Despite the replacement, the statue of Bhagawati is returned to Nuwakot for a brief period each April, a tradition that continues to this day.\nThis temple thus holds historical and religious significance as both a symbol of Jagajjaya Malla's political maneuvering and the evolving traditions of Nepal's early rulers (Asian Historical Architecture, n.d.; NHDP, n.d.).",

Known locally as \"Maru Satah,\" it stands out as the largest Satah in the valley and features an open ground floor, unlike other rest houses. The term \"maru\" likely originates from \"mandap,\" meaning pavilion. The structure\u2019s various names reflect its rich history, including \u201cYa\u1e45gramando\u201d during the Licchavi period.\nBelieved to have been built primarily from a single s\u0101la tree, the structure is supported by four massive pillars and has three tiers. The ground floor houses a statue of Gorakhnath, likely installed in the 14th century, alongside four Ganesh statues at its corners. Nearby landmarks are also named after Kasthamandap, emphasizing its central role in the area\u2019s cultural identity.\nThe exact date of its construction is debated. While some sources suggest it was built during King Lakshminarasimha Malla's reign (1619-1641 AD), references in earlier manuscripts date the structure back to at least the 11th century. Legends connect its creation to the wish-fulfilling tree, Kalpav\u1e5bk\u1e63a, which provided the timber for its construction in 1595 AD.\nKasthamandap\u2019s relationship with ascetics dates back to the 15th century, when land donations began supporting their residence there. In the 20th century, the structure housed ascetic communities, who collected rent from shops within it. The site was a hub for public announcements and rituals, highlighting its societal importance.\nIn 2015, the structure collapsed during a devastating earthquake, killing ten people and burying many inscriptions. Excavations revealed that its foundation dates back to the 7th century. Reconstruction began in 2018 and was completed in 2022, though the site remains closed due to ongoing legal disputes over the replacement of damaged statues. (Bajracharya, 1976)",

The temple has undergone several renovations, including after the 1934 earthquake and most recently in 2013-14 through a collaboration between the local community and Kathmandu Metropolis, which altered the upper structure. Despite these changes, some original elements like stone pillars, a wooden arch (torana), and terra cotta kinnara statues remain, indicating its later-medieval origins. The sanctum houses a stone \u015bivali\u1e45ga as the principal deity.\nOnce significant in the local socio-religious context, the temple's daily rituals were maintained by a family from the Udaya community until the early 1990s. However, the temple is now neglected, with no regular rituals except for a bonfire lit by locals during Shivaratri. Despite its historic importance, the temple currently lacks care and attention.

                "history": "Silyan Satah, originally constructed from leftover timber from the Kasthamandap building, is a multi-storied rest house. The name \"Silyan Satah\" translates to \"rest house built from surplus timber.\" In 1929 AD (BS 1986), large winged lion statues were added, and the building was renamed Si\u1e43ha Satah (\"lion rest house\"). Located south of Kasthamandap, it features a three-story structure with a tiled roof and gilded finial. The second floor has a veranda and houses a Va\u1e43\u015b\u012bdhara Krishna statue, accompanied by statues of Ganesh and another Krishna. Uniquely, a Garu\u1e0da statue is placed inside rather than outside the building, a common feature in Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava temples.\nLegend suggests the timber used for construction came from a s\u0101la tree (Shorea robusta), with any excess buried between Silyan Satah and Kasthamandap. After a fire destroyed Subb\u0101 Dharman\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a M\u0101nandhar's house, a Krishna statue was discovered, later enshrined in the rest house by his son, Har\u1e63an\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who established a social trust (guthi) to maintain rituals.\nThe original design of the building is unknown, but the current structure was a renovation by Har\u1e63an\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a M\u0101nandhar, who added seventeen ground-floor rooms to generate income for rituals. Winged lion statues were added in 1929 AD (BS 1986) by Jogam\u0101y\u0101 M\u0101nandhar in memory of her son, leading to the name change. Following the takeover by Guthi Sa\u1e43sth\u0101na, the building's condition and cultural activities declined due to insufficient funding. A restoration project, interrupted by the 2015 AD earthquakes, was completed in 2017 AD (BS 2074). As of March 2023 AD, the ground floor operates as a Tourist Information Center managed by Kathmandu Metropolis (NHDP, n.d.).",

Built in 1657 AD (NS 777) by King Pratap Malla, it was originally one of the tallest structures in Kathmandu Durbar Square. The name Kabindrapur, meaning \"Mansion of Kavindra,\" refers to Pratap Malla's self-given title, \"Lord of Poets.\"\nThis three-tiered building blends a temple and a Satah (rest house) design. The structure is topped with traditional tile roofs and three finials. Its ground floor features 13 arcaded bays, with the middle seven extending outward to form a prominent upper balcony (pula). The original building had an additional tier, which was lost during the 1934 earthquake.\nThe main deity on the ground floor is Nasahdyah, the god of music and drama, represented by a small triangular hole in the wall. Other deities, including Narasi\u1e43ha, Bhringi, and Chamunda, are also enshrined. The top level holds a shrine to Bhavanishankar, representing the Vaishnav triad of Jagannath, SuBhadra, and BalaBhadra. The temple holds historical significance, as King Pratap Malla built it to appease Narasi\u1e43ha, who was angered by the king impersonating him in a dance. The king installed a statue of Narasimha alongside Nasahdyah.\nA Shakya woman currently performs daily rituals at the Nasahdyah shrine. The temple plays a key role in Kathmandu's cultural life, particularly for traditional music and dance training. Every 12 years, mask dances of Bhadrak\u0101l\u012b from Naradev\u012b and Khokan\u0101 are performed in front of Kabindrapur, with dance troupes residing in the temple\u2019s upper hall. Kabindrapur remains a testament to King Pratap Malla\u2019s devotion, creativity, and the cultural vibrancy of his reign. (NHDP, n.d.)",

Income generated from the land was intended to sustain daily worship and special festival rituals.\nWhen establishing the temple, Vimaleshwardas stipulated that on the day of Shivaratri, the Shivalinga should be worshipped with panchamrit, and lamps should be lit. Similarly, lamps were to be lit throughout the duration of Indra Jatra. On the temple's annual anniversary, after feeding Brahmins, Joshis, and Acharyas (Karmacharyas), lamps were to be lit in the evening.\nAny leftover funds from these rituals were to be used for the temple\u2019s maintenance. However, these religious activities are no longer regularly conducted as originally inscribed on the stone slab. Daily worship has been suspended since the earthquake, though the special Shivaratri worship continues uninterrupted. (NHDP, n.d.)",

(Asian Historical Architecture, n.d.)\nIn front of the temple, a rare Malla-period Garuda statue kneels in a prayerful posture facing the temple. Installed in 1689 AD by Queen Riddhi Lakshmi (Nripendra Malla's widow), the statue is noted for its remarkable craftsmanship and lifelike detail.\nThe temple is also known for the annual Dasavatar (Ten Incarnations of Vishnu) exhibition during the Indra Jatra festival, where the Manandhar community of Maru Tole showcases lively displays of Vishnu's avatars. Due to this tradition, the temple is colloquially called the \"Dasavatar Dekhaune Mandir.\" (NHDP, n.d.)",

Located in the Layaku area (Hanuman Dhoka Royal Palace region), it is situated west of the Kumari Bahah in Basantapur. Inside the sanctum is a stone statue of Maitreya Buddha, which replaced an older wooden statue.\nThe monastery is home to five Licchavi-era chaityas and is also historically significant as the residence of the Royal Guru, who served at the Hanuman Dhoka Palace during the medieval period. The name \"Sikhomu\" is believed to derive from a pile of logs used for the construction of Kasthamandap. Some locals speculate that it was built from the roots of a sandalwood tree, based on its Sanskrit name, Shreekhanda Taramul Mahavihar.\nWhile the historical evidence of its construction is sparse, the earliest confirmed reference to Sikhomu Bahah appears in an inscription from NS 492 (1372 AD). The monastery\u2019s Royal Guru, Gyanak\u012brti, played a role in overseeing rituals following the 1349 AD invasion by Sultan Shamsuddin of Bengal, which damaged the Swoyambhu Stupa. Over the centuries, scholars and priests from Sikhomu Bahah have contributed to religious texts and rituals.\nThe monastery's land once spanned from Kal Bhairav to Atko Narayan, but portions were appropriated during the reign of Jayaprakash Malla for the construction of the Kumari House. After the 1934 earthquake, further land was seized, with several Bahahs relocated, including to Ranamuktishwor.\nTraditionally, the Royal Guru from Sikhomu Bahah led rituals at the Hanuman Dhoka Palace, but this role was shifted to the Brahmin P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0des after Prithvi Narayan Shah\u2019s conquest. The cultural significance of the Royal Guru continues, with the current Royal Guru, Manjushriratna Bajracharya, performing daily rituals at the Kumari House. Rituals such as K\u012bk\u0101l\u0101 Guthi and Poh\u0113l\u0101 Guthi are also part of the monastery's traditions (NHDP, n.d.).",

                "history": "Kumari Bahah, also known as Kumari Ch\u0115 or Kumari Ghar, is the residence of the living Kumari, a young girl revered as a goddess in both Hindu and Buddhist traditions. The term Kumari Ch\u0115 highlights its role as the abode of the Kumari, who is considered the living embodiment of Taleju Bhawani. In addition to this, it is historically identified as R\u0101jak\u012brti Manorama Vihara, possibly named after a king who built it to ensure his lasting fame. It is also known as R\u0101jalak\u1e63m\u012b Vihara in Vajray\u0101na Buddhism, where the goddess Vasundhar\u0101, equated with both Kumari and Lak\u1e63m\u012b, is worshiped.\nThe origin of the Kumari tradition in Nepal is rooted in a tale from the Malla period. King Jaya Prakash Malla, who secretly played a game of dice with Goddess Taleju every night, was bound by a strict rule: he could not reveal this to anyone, not even a hint. However, his wife grew suspicious of his nightly absences and decided to follow him one evening. She discovered the king with the goddess in a secluded room, playing the game. The queen\u2019s intrusion angered\nTaleju, and as a result, the goddess disappeared. Despite the king\u2019s pleas and rituals to bring her back, Taleju declared that she would not return but would instead reside within a girl of the Shakya community. Thus, the tradition of the Kumari began, with a young girl chosen to embody the goddess Taleju, and the custom has continued to this day as an important spiritual and cultural practice in Nepal.\nArchitecturally, Kumari Bahah is a three-story Vihara featuring an open courtyard. The entrance is guarded by two stone lions, and intricate carvings of deities, such as Ganesh, Bhairava, and Mahi\u1e63amardin\u012b D\u016brg\u0101, symbolize Taleju Bhawani. The upper floors have beautifully carved lattice windows, including the central Kumari jhya, which is gilded. Inside, the sanctum houses the kv\u0101p\u0101dya\u1e25 of Pa\u00f1ca Buddha along with statues of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Vihara has dal\u0101nas (verandas) providing access to rooms and ritual spaces, including the Kumari's bedroom and the \u0101gamak\u014d\u1e6dh\u0101 for special p\u016bj\u0101s.\nKumari Bahah is not only the Kumari's residence but also a vibrant center of cultural activities. Various p\u016bj\u0101s and festivals, including Dashain and Indra Jatra, are conducted, and the Kumari plays an essential role in the chariot procession, paraded through Kathmandu accompanied by other deities and traditional dancers. Kumari Bahah thus remains a symbol of Kathmandu's rich cultural and spiritual heritage (KMC Ward 23 Office, n.d.).",

The name \"Nhuchen Chowk\" refers to \"the chowk with the new house,\" as mentioned in the records of King Jayaprakash Malla.\nIn BS 1904, Jung Bahadur Rana demolished a house in this chowk and constructed a new building blending Newari and modern styles, known as Nolsi Durbar. The upper floor housed a grand meeting room, LalBaithak, where formal ceremonies were held, including medal exchanges and meetings with foreign representatives.\nIn BS 1965, Chandra Shumsher demolished the LalBaithak and built the current Gaddi Baithak, where the Rajgaddi (royal throne) has been kept in the meeting room. The design was by Kishore Narsingh and Kumar Narsingh Rana, who also designed Singha Durbar. The European-style building features a grand staircase, though its initial placement near the Kumari house caused difficulties for worship, prompting a redesign.\nThe Gaddi Baithak suffered damage from earthquakes, including the 1990 earthquake, after which it was swiftly rebuilt. It was again damaged in the 2015 earthquake but retrofitted within a year (Hanumandhoka Durbar Museum Development Committee, 2024, August)",
