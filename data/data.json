    "history": "Boudha Stupa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a blend of Newar, Tamang, Sherpa, and Tibetan cultures, making it a unique symbol of the rich cultural and spiritual diversity of the Kathmandu Valley. Located in the northeastern part of Kathmandu, this massive stupa is one of the largest in the world and serves as a major pilgrimage site for Buddhists from different traditions. The stupa's grand dome, adorned with the Buddha's all-seeing eyes, reflects the region's deep Buddhist heritage. Surrounding the stupa are numerous monasteries, shrines, and shops, creating a lively atmosphere where local traditions and rituals thrive. The area is especially significant during major Buddhist festivals like Buddha Jayanti and the Boudha Stupa Jatra, when devotees from diverse communities come together to celebrate and perform rituals. The cultural richness of Boudha makes it not only a religious hub but also a cultural crossroads, offering visitors a glimpse into the harmonious blending of various Buddhist traditions.\nHistory\nBoudha Stupa is one of the largest and most significant Buddhist sites in Nepal. Its origin remains unclear, with various historical sources offering different accounts. According to Nepalese records, the stupa was constructed during the Licchavi period. Gopal Raj Vansavali, a historical chronicle, credits King Shiva Dev with the construction of the stupa, while Mary Slusser suggests that King Mandeva may have been involved in its initial erection, with Shiva Dev later renovating it. Tibetan sources associate Boudha with King Songtsen Gampo, who is believed to have initiated the establishment of Buddhist temples, including the one at Boudha. After the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959, Boudha became a key center for Tibetan exiles, significantly contributing to its religious and cultural development.\n\nLegends of Boudha Stupa\n1. Kathmandu Legend: A prominent legend associated with the Boudha Stupa originates from Kathmandu during the Licchavi period. According to the story, King Dharmadev constructed a stone spout near his palace, but it mysteriously dried up, causing a severe drought in the kingdom. Distressed, the king consulted astrologers, who advised him to perform a human sacrifice to bring an end to the drought. They instructed the king to sacrifice someone who possessed all thirty-two virtues, a rare attribute. After an extensive search, it was discovered that only the king and his son, Manadeva, possessed these virtues.\nReluctant to sacrifice his son, the king decided to offer his own life and instructed Manadeva to decapitate a hooded stranger at the stone spout the next morning. However, when Manadeva returned to the palace, he realized, to his horror, that he had unwittingly killed his father. Filled with grief and guilt, Manadeva renounced the throne and chose to live a life of seclusion.\nAs time passed, the kingdom continued to suffer from the drought. In his despair, Manadeva had a vision in which Vajra Yogini appeared to him, instructing him to release a bird and build a stupa at the spot where the bird landed. Following this vision, Manadeva released a bird, and it landed at the site of what would become the Boudha Stupa. The construction of the stupa was difficult due to a lack of water to mix the clay. However, the laborers ingeniously collected dew using large sheets of cloth, which allowed them to complete the stupa. The use of dew, known as \"khasu ti\" in Nepal Bhasa, led to the stupa being named Khasu Ti Chaitya, a name that later evolved into Khasti Chaitya.\n2. Tibetan Legend: A different, yet equally significant, legend comes from Tibetan Buddhism. According to this account, Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, had vowed to release all sentient beings from suffering. After years of efforts, Avalokitesvara looked down from his palace, only to find that many beings continued to suffer, despite his best efforts. Overcome by despair, Avalokitesvara wept, and his tears fell to the ground. These teardrops were believed to have transformed into the daughters of Indra, the king of the gods.\nOne of these daughters, Apurna, was born as a human named Jadzima, into a humble family. As she grew up, Jadzima worked hard to support her children and eventually saved enough money to fulfill a noble aspiration—to build a grand stupa that would help alleviate suffering. Despite opposition from the local nobility, who were jealous of her plans, the king granted her permission to build the stupa. The stupa came to be known as \"Jharung Khasor,\" meaning \"permission to build,\" symbolizing the king’s approval despite the resistance from the powerful elites. This stupa, built with the intention to end suffering, continues to serve as a significant religious and cultural landmark.",

This deity, known by different names across communities, is seen as a protective goddess. In Tibetan Buddhism, she is referred to as Jadzima, while Newars call her Ajima, meaning \"Grandmother.\" Hindus may associate her with deities like Sitala or Chamunda, fierce figures often depicted consuming corpses. Though considered wrathful, Ajima is seen as a protector, granting power to her devotees. The temple's origins and interpretations vary, with some connecting her to Hariti, a demoness who later became a protector of Buddha's shrines.",

    "name": "Swoyambhu Mahachaitya",
    "location": "Kathmandu",
    "history": "The Swoyambhu Stupa is situated to the northwest of Kathmandu, atop a green hill known by various names: 'Gau Puche Parbat', 'Padmagiri' and 'Vajrakutta Parbat'. Nearby is Manjushree Hill, also referred to as 'Gau Singhe Parbat'. These hills are named 'Gau Singhe' and 'Gau Puche' because, from Nagarjun Hill, their shapes resemble a cow. Manjushree Hill appears as a cow's horn, while Swoyambhu Hill resembles the cow's tail.\nThe Swoyambhu Stupa, estimated to be over 1,500 years old, is a highly revered landmark in the Kathmandu Valley. The term 'Swoyambhu' in Nepal Bhasa translates to 'self-sprung' or 'self-manifested'. The most common route to the summit involves climbing 365 steps from the front entrance. Alternatively, the rear entrance, accessible by car or scooter, requires only a few steps to reach the top. The site’s integration of Hindu and Buddhist elements creates a distinctive and harmonious fusion of traditions that is seldom encountered elsewhere. (Buddhacharya, A. M. (2024, June 13). Insights on Swoyambhu Stupa [Interview with a local cultural expert].)\n● Mythology of Swoyambhu\nAccording to the Swoyambhu Purana, the Kathmandu Valley was once a vast and beautiful lake. When Vipaswi Buddha arrived, he planted a lotus seed at the site where the Swoyambhu Stupa now stands. The seed grew into a magnificent lotus with a thousand petals, its radiant light was visible from afar and drawing many pilgrims. Due to its luminous quality, the site came to be known as Jyoti Chaitya or Ratna Chaitya.\nImpressed by the divine light of the lotus, Manjushri believed that draining the lake would make the site more accessible to human pilgrims. Using his great sword, he carved a gorge in the surrounding mountains, allowing the water to drain and revealing the valley that is now Kathmandu. As the lake dried up, the lotus emerged on the hill, which eventually became the location of the Swoyambhu Stupa.\nMany years later, Shantikaracharya, who came to Nepal on pilgrimage, recognized the need to preserve this sacred light. To honor and protect the spot where the lotus had once bloomed, he is believed to have constructed the stupa. (Buddhacharya, A. M. (2024, June 13). Insights on Swoyambhu Stupa [Interview with a local cultural expert].)\n● History of Swoyambhu\nAccording to the Gopal Raj Vamsavali, a 14th-century manuscript from Nepal, the Swoyambhu Stupa was established by King Vrsadeva, the great-grandfather of King Manadeva (464–505 CE), during the Licchavi period in the early 5th century CE. This is supported by a damaged stone inscription at the site, which records that King Manadeva commissioned further work in 640 CE. Additionally, Emperor Ashoka is believed to have visited the site in the 3rd century BCE and constructed an early temple, which subsequently fell into disrepair for reasons that remain unknown. In 1349, during the first Muslim invasion of Kathmandu, the Swoyambhu Stupa was completely destroyed. It was subsequently repaired. Following the construction of the main stupa, additional monuments were added over time by various dynasties. The eastern stairway was built in the 17th century by King Pratap Malla, a prominent ruler of Kathmandu. (Vredeveld, n.d.)\nIn 1918 CE, with authorization from the Nepalese government, the 14th major renovation of Sri Swoyambhu Mahachaitya was undertaken. This restoration involved replacing the harmika and repairing the 13 bronze disks. The work was completed over a period of three years, finishing in 1921 CE. (Tuladhar, 2021)\nThe 15th renovation of Sri Swoyambhu MahaChaitya occurred between 2008 and 2010, resembling a massive jigsaw puzzle. Over 30,000 pieces were carefully removed, repaired, cleaned, and reassembled using more than 100,000 nails. Additionally, all the metal plates received a fresh layer of gold, utilizing 20 kg of the precious metal is one of the largest gold restoration projects ever undertaken. (Parashar, 2010)\n\n● Buddhacharya Family\nThe Buddhacharya family descends from four legendary brothers tasked with preserving the traditions, norms, and values of Swoyambhu, as designated by Shantikar Acharya. The community is divided into four lineages—referred to as \"KA: WA:\"—which trace their roots back to these brothers, who established the clan centuries ago. Together, these lineages encompass 30 families, each representing the legacy of one of the four brothers. Each group has its own leader, guiding their members in honoring their shared heritage.

The exact date of Shantipur's establishment is uncertain, but it is believed to have been built by Shantikar Acharya, a revered Tantric master.

By 2001 B.S., the structure was finalized under Bhikshu Dharma Lok Mahasthavir's guidance. Three Buddha relics from Sri Lanka, symbolizing his birthplace in Nepal, were presented to King Tribhuvan. A stupa resembling Sri Lanka's Thuparama Chaitya was built to house these relics. Known for its Theravada Buddhism practice, the monastery offers free meditation to both locals and visitors, with a full day of meditation held on the fourth Saturday of every month.",
