    "location": "Kathmandu",
    "history": "The Swoyambhu Stupa is situated to the northwest of Kathmandu, atop a green hill known by various names: 'Gau Puche Parbat', 'Padmagiri' and 'Vajrakutta Parbat'. Nearby is Manjushree Hill, also referred to as 'Gau Singhe Parbat'. These hills are named 'Gau Singhe' and 'Gau Puche' because, from Nagarjun Hill, their shapes resemble a cow. Manjushree Hill appears as a cow's horn, while Swoyambhu Hill resembles the cow's tail.\nThe Swoyambhu Stupa, estimated to be over 1,500 years old, is a highly revered landmark in the Kathmandu Valley. The term 'Swoyambhu' in Nepal Bhasa translates to 'self-sprung' or 'self-manifested'. The most common route to the summit involves climbing 365 steps from the front entrance. Alternatively, the rear entrance, accessible by car or scooter, requires only a few steps to reach the top. The site’s integration of Hindu and Buddhist elements creates a distinctive and harmonious fusion of traditions that is seldom encountered elsewhere. (Buddhacharya, A. M. (2024, June 13). Insights on Swoyambhu Stupa [Interview with a local cultural expert].)\n● Mythology of Swoyambhu\nAccording to the Swoyambhu Purana, the Kathmandu Valley was once a vast and beautiful lake. When Vipaswi Buddha arrived, he planted a lotus seed at the site where the Swoyambhu Stupa now stands. The seed grew into a magnificent lotus with a thousand petals, its radiant light was visible from afar and drawing many pilgrims. Due to its luminous quality, the site came to be known as Jyoti Chaitya or Ratna Chaitya.\nImpressed by the divine light of the lotus, Manjushri believed that draining the lake would make the site more accessible to human pilgrims. Using his great sword, he carved a gorge in the surrounding mountains, allowing the water to drain and revealing the valley that is now Kathmandu. As the lake dried up, the lotus emerged on the hill, which eventually became the location of the Swoyambhu Stupa.\nMany years later, Shantikaracharya, who came to Nepal on pilgrimage, recognized the need to preserve this sacred light. To honor and protect the spot where the lotus had once bloomed, he is believed to have constructed the stupa. (Buddhacharya, A. M. (2024, June 13). Insights on Swoyambhu Stupa [Interview with a local cultural expert].)\n● History of Swoyambhu\nAccording to the Gopal Raj Vamsavali, a 14th-century manuscript from Nepal, the Swoyambhu Stupa was established by King Vrsadeva, the great-grandfather of King Manadeva (464–505 CE), during the Licchavi period in the early 5th century CE. This is supported by a damaged stone inscription at the site, which records that King Manadeva commissioned further work in 640 CE. Additionally, Emperor Ashoka is believed to have visited the site in the 3rd century BCE and constructed an early temple, which subsequently fell into disrepair for reasons that remain unknown. In 1349, during the first Muslim invasion of Kathmandu, the Swoyambhu Stupa was completely destroyed. It was subsequently repaired. Following the construction of the main stupa, additional monuments were added over time by various dynasties. The eastern stairway was built in the 17th century by King Pratap Malla, a prominent ruler of Kathmandu. (Vredeveld, n.d.)\nIn 1918 CE, with authorization from the Nepalese government, the 14th major renovation of Sri Swoyambhu Mahachaitya was undertaken. This restoration involved replacing the harmika and repairing the 13 bronze disks. The work was completed over a period of three years, finishing in 1921 CE. (Tuladhar, 2021)\nThe 15th renovation of Sri Swoyambhu MahaChaitya occurred between 2008 and 2010, resembling a massive jigsaw puzzle. Over 30,000 pieces were carefully removed, repaired, cleaned, and reassembled using more than 100,000 nails. Additionally, all the metal plates received a fresh layer of gold, utilizing 20 kg of the precious metal is one of the largest gold restoration projects ever undertaken. (Parashar, 2010)\n\n● Buddhacharya Family\nThe Buddhacharya family descends from four legendary brothers tasked with preserving the traditions, norms, and values of Swoyambhu, as designated by Shantikar Acharya. The community is divided into four lineages—referred to as \"KA: WA:\"—which trace their roots back to these brothers, who established the clan centuries ago. Together, these lineages encompass 30 families, each representing the legacy of one of the four brothers. Each group has its own leader, guiding their members in honoring their shared heritage. (Buddhacharya et al., 2019)",
