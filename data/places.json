    "history": "Hadigaun, one of the oldest and most historically significant settlements in the Kathmandu Valley, was once the heart of Nepal's Licchavi civilization, serving as the ancient capital and a thriving center of culture, religion, and politics. Its temples, stone spouts, and inscriptions bear testimony to its royal legacy and spiritual prominence. However, with the rise of modern urbanization and neglect of its heritage, Hadigaun has gradually lost its central role and much of its historical grandeur. Despite this, studying Handigaun is crucial, as it holds untapped insights into Nepal\u2019s ancient urbanization, religious syncretism, and architectural innovations, serving as a key to understanding the nation\u2019s rich cultural and historical identity.",

        "location": "Handigaun",
        "history": "The BhatBhateni Temple, located northwest of Hadigaun, is dedicated to the deities Bhat, Bhateni, and their child, Nanda/Bal Gopal. The temple is unique in that the deities are suspended on the wall instead of being placed on the ground, a distinctive feature (Acharya, 2021). The deities are also known by local names such as Brahmayani, \"\u0939\u094d\u092e\u094b\u092a\u0924\u093e \u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b/Mhopata Dhyo,\" \"\u092e\u0947 \u092e\u0948\u091a\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b/Me MaichaDhyo,\" and \"\u092e\u094b\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940/Mopata Devi,\" and are believed to have the power to heal children's ailments. The temple's origins may date back to the Lichhavi period, with some believing it is linked to the Toran Ajima/Tudal Devi Temple, which contains an inscription from 475 A.D during King Manadeva's reign (Dikshita, 2059).\nA prominent legend tells the story of a devout Brahmin couple, Sudev and Sudevi, from Bishalnagar (the ancient name for Hadigaun). The couple, known for their unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu, were blessed with spiritual knowledge and earned the names \"Bhat\" and \"Bhateni.\" They prayed for a child with all the good qualities of Vishnu. As they were too old to bear children at the time, Lord Vishnu promised them a child in the next life. Reborn into poverty, the couple continued their devotion to Vishnu and were blessed with a son who embodied all the attributes of Vishnu.\nOne day, an old Brahmin named Suddadev visited their home, and knowing of their exemplary character, he left behind a walking stick containing gold and set off on a 12-year pilgrimage. The couple, unaware of the gold inside, noticed the stick beginning to rot and discovered the gold. Struggling financially, they sold it, believing that Suddadev would not survive his pilgrimage. However, upon his return, Suddadev discovered the deceit. After initially being lied to by the couple, he saw a Garuda circling above, and it became clear to him that his stick had been sold. He cursed the couple, declaring, \u201cLiars like you should not find land on this earth to set foot on. If my stick could be eaten away by moths, then surely that eagle above can swoop down and carry away your child.\u201d At that moment, the Garuda swooped down and carried away the baby. The couple, having accumulated religious merit, found the strength to rise into the air to retrieve their son. To their surprise, their child revealed his true form\u2014he was Vishnu-Narayan riding the Garuda. Vishnu, pleased by their devotion, blessed them, saying, \u201cYou shall remain in the sky as gods as you have remained loyal to me.\u201d This legend explains why the images of Bhat and Bhateni are suspended in the temple (Acharya, 2021).\nAnother legend involves a farmer couple devoted to Vishnu, who prayed for the deity to be born as their child. Vishnu granted their wish, and in the next life, they were blessed with a child. One day, while the child was basking in the sun after being oiled, Garuda swooped down and took the child. The parents, chasing after the eagle, witnessed their son transform into Vishnu on Garuda's back. Vishnu, moved by their unwavering devotion, blessed them, allowing them to remain in the sky as gods.\nThe BhatBhateni Temple is a two-tiered structure with a copper roof and a golden pinnacle. The outer walls of the temple are adorned with carvings of the Astamatrikas, Ganesha, and other figures from the Malla period. The deities inside the temple face west and are suspended in the air to avoid startling visitors with their large images upon entry .(Karmacharya, P. (2024, November 8). Insights on Bhatbhateni Temple [Interview with Priest of the temple].) The temple is maintained by the Karmacharya clan, who perform daily rituals and uphold the temple's vibrant religious significance (Acharya, 2021).\nThe temple plays a central role in Hadigaun's cultural practices, particularly for parents praying for the health of their children. The annual jatra begins on Chaitra Sukla Chaturdasi (mid-April), with the deities temporarily housed at the Toran Ajima Temple. They are returned after a Hom Puja on Chaitra Sukla Purnima (late April). The temple sees increased visits on Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, when locals come to offer prayers and seek blessings.\u2019",

This two-tiered structure is dedicated to Lord Bhimsen, with an image of the deity dating back to medieval times. The temple marks a significant entrance point to Hadigaun from the northwest, possibly serving as a historical access point to the city.\nThe temple is renowned for hosting the annual Bhimsen Jatra, which occurs alongside the Toran Ajima/Tudal Devi Jatra. These events are major cultural highlights for the community. The temple is currently cared for by the Dangol family, particularly SubhaNarayan Dangol, a local resident. A replica of the enshrined image is kept at the Dangol household and displayed during the Toran Ajima Jatra and Holi Purnima. The temple also hosts several important religious activities, including the Hom Puja during Si Punhi/Purnima (Magh full moon), Bhin Dwadasi (when food offerings are made to the deity), and Holi Purnima. (Dangol, S. N. (2024, November 14). Insights on Bhindyo Temple [Interview with Ritual Custodian of the temple].)\nHistorically, a Falcha (resting platform) once stood on the eastern side of the temple, but it was replaced by a club building (Tiwari, 2002). To the south of the temple is a Shakti Pith, housing images of deities such as Sankata, Mahankal, and Surya Narayan, as well as an upright stone symbolizing Lord Bhairav. Among these, a headless torso of Lord Shiva holding a Kamandalu is believed to date back to the early Licchavi period. To the southeast of the temple lies a Shivalinga, associated with a legendary fire that once devastated much of Hadigaun.\nTo the west of the temple, there was once a water well, and according to local lore, the Dhanamati river once flowed through this area. (Dangol, S. N. (2024, November 14). Insights on Bhindyo Temple [Interview with Ritual Custodian of the temple].) In recent years, additional structures have been added to the area, including a small Lord Ganesha temple to the south and a temple dedicated to Dakshinkali Bhagwati to the north, further enriching the region\u2019s religious and cultural landscape.",

        "history": "The Dhana Ganesha Temple, located in the northern part of Hadigaun, is a historic two-story structure dedicated to the worship of significant deities. The eastern shrine enshrines the primary deity, Dhana Ganesha, while the identity of the deity in the western shrine remains a subject of debate.\nThe temple is believed to date back to the Licchavi period. The statue of Dhana Ganesha in the eastern shrine is notably fragmented; its left hand was once holding sweetmeats (laddu), while the object in its right hand remains uncertain. The statue in the western shrine is also contested, with some suggesting that it represents Bhairava, and others believing it depicts another form of Ganesha. Given the presence of a Bhairava image on the Toran (archway) above, it is likely that the statue in the western shrine represents Bhairava.\nDhana Ganesha, also known as Rog Vinayak, is revered for its healing powers, particularly in treating ailments. The second shrine is often referred to as Rog Vinayak, though this connection is still under research. The temple houses several ancient relics, including a 5th-century Hayagriva statue, a 2nd-century Mahisasurmardini, and an unidentified deity. The Hayagriva statue, revered by farmers as Balar\u0101ma, is the oldest of its kind in Nepal (Bangdel, 1982). Many of these statues were damaged during an Islamic invasion.\nA local legend connects the Dhana Ganesha Temple to Chandra Vinayak in Chabahil. According to the myth, the original Chandra Vinayak statue, once enshrined in the Dhana Ganesha Temple, was stolen and dragged to Chabahil, earning it the name \"Lhwasaala Ganedyo\" (the dragged stone Ganesha). In response, the people of Hadigaun created a replacement statue, which is now worshipped as Dhana Ganesha. This myth links the two deities, and both statues are part of an annual procession that occurs on the day following the full moon of Kartik.(Prajapati, S. L. (2024, November 8). Insights on Dhana Ganesha Temple [Interview with President of the Conservation and Reformation Committee].)\nThe temple underwent renovations in 2003 A.D (BS 2060), which included the installation of a copper roof, a new finial, a bell, and marble flooring (Tiwari, 2002). Historically, the temple was managed by a Karmacharya priest, but currently, a Maharjan caretaker (dyahpahlah) from the local community performs the rituals. The temple holds significant cultural importance for the people of Hadigaun, who worship there during community festivals, personal rituals such as Pashni (the first rice feeding ceremony for a child), and on every Tuesday, when a replica of the Ganesha statue is brought out for worship.\nThe temple premises originally occupied 5 Ropani and 4 Aana of land. However, by 2045 B.S., the area was reduced to 3 Ropani and 7 Aana (Prajapati, K. L. (2024, November 8). Insights on Dhana Ganesha Temple [Interview with V- President of the Conservation and Reformation Committee].)). Despite these changes, the temple remains a central cultural and religious landmark in Hadigaun.\n",

This Shivalinga is one of the prominent Piths among the 16,000 Piths of Sati Devi, the first wife of Mahadev. The area surrounding Bhuteshwor Bhairava includes several historical monuments from different periods. These include the Swasthani Yantra, over which Bhuteshwor Bhairava is considered the protector, a Dabali, Krishna Mandir, a newly added Chaitya, and temples dedicated to Narayana. The Narayana temples were relocated from the west during a road expansion. Before their relocation, one temple was built in a shikhar style, and the other in a tiered style. According to the ward member, the original Bhuteshwor Bhairava shrine was situated a few feet below ground and lacked the structural features seen today.(Karmacharya, B. P. (2024, November 14).

The festival begins on Chaitra Sukla Astami and ends on Baisakh Krishna Navami with the lowering of the poles (Tiwari, 2023).\nThe Yoshin raised at Bhuteshwor includes a halipata, a Kirat totem representing nagas, symbolizing Bhuteshwor Bhairav. The Yoshin at Dabali, though similar, lacks the halipata. The pole raising marks the Kirat New Year and honors both the king and the tutelary goddess at different locations (Tiwari, 2023).\nThe Yoshins are also seen as an invitation to celestial beings for the Tudal Devi Jatra, and the community observes several restrictions, including not sleeping outside the town, refraining from wearing imported shoes, and prohibiting loan repayments after the raising of Yoshins.

This complex contains three hiti, with two facing east and one facing south (Acharya, 2021).\nThe stone water spout, originating from the Licchavi period, channels water from Gahana Pokhari, which is situated at a higher elevation on the western side of Hadigaun, and drains into the Dhobi Khola river (Tiwari, 2002). This hiti may be religiously and culturally linked to the nearby Satyanarayan Temple, indicating that further research is needed to explore these.",

A Lichhavi inscription reveals that Bhaumagupta, a powerful regent, usurped land grants that had been donated for the temple\u2019s upkeep (Tiwari, 2002).\nInscriptions suggest that the site remained active until at least 818 AD, when Bhagyachandra installed a deity image there (Bajracharya, 2025 BS). However, the inscribed stone from the late Lichhavi period is now lost (Tiwari, 2002). Historically, Bhima Nani was part of a renowned Kirat-era temple complex called Bhuvaneswor Devkul. This temple and its surrounding area were culturally significant, with a rare stepped well located to the west, now within a private garden. The well, believed to carry holy water and guarded by the naga (serpent deity), plays an important role in the Chokhate Narayan Jatra. It may have also been part of Hadigaun\u2019s Lichchhavi-era water supply system.\nEfforts by King Narendradev to restore Bhuvaneswor Devkul after the disturbances and the fire of the late 7th century were unsuccessful, and the site eventually faded into obscurity. Interestingly, the Shivalinga\u2019s Jalhari (water basin) faces the Ishan Kon (northeast), unlike most Shivalingas, which face north. The presence of another water well to the south, near the residence of the Mahantas, further suggests the site\u2019s religious, cultural, and political significance in its prime (Acharya, S. (2024, November 12). Insights on Bhimanani [Interview with Local Resident].).",

Another legend recounts how a sage, facing potential harm during a famine, transformed into the fish-shaped stone to escape being consumed.\nReligiously, Nya Lho is integral to the Tudaldevi Jatra. During the festival, the palanquin of Tudaldevi is placed on the stone before proceeding to Gahana Pokhari.

These ponds, strategically placed near the Manmaneshwari Temple, formed part of a sophisticated water management system. Gahana Pokhari served as a reservoir, supplying water to local wells and a stone spout near the Satyanarayan Temple, highlighting its dual role in daily utility and sacred rituals (Tiwari, 2023). Its oval shape and strategic positioning suggest its importance as a sacred space and water resource, with historical ties to the Kailashkut Bhawan complex, an ancient royal palace.

Serving as the tutelary deity of both the Licchavi and Malla kings, the temple holds great historical and cultural significance.\nArchitecturally, the temple is a Dyochhen (god-house) with a tiled roof. Its upper floor is vacant, while the ground floor houses the sanctum with carvings of Bhairava and Mahalakshmi on surviving struts. The sanctum contains a Bhagavati statue installed by King Bhaskar Malla in 1702 A.D and a unique Shivalinga, Maneshwar Mahadeva, notable for lacking a jalhari and receiving animal sacrifices. Other deities, including Ganesha, Kumar, and Annapurna, also form part of the shrine.\nHistorically, the temple played a prominent role during the Licchavi period, with King Mandeva adopting the goddess as his tutelary deity. An inscription from A\u1e43\u015buvarm\u0101\u2019s reign (608 CE) references Maneshwara, the male counterpart of the goddess, further underscoring its ancient roots. The tradition continued under the Malla kings, with significant contributions from King Bhaskar Malla and later recognition through tax exemptions by King Prithvi Narayan Shah in 1771 A.D and land grants by King Girvanayuddha in 1799 A.D.\nExcavations in 1965 AD unearthed numerous artifacts, including Pashupati coins and stone seals from the reign of A\u1e43\u015buvarm\u0101, affirming the temple's Licchavi origins. A 750 A.D water tank (Jarun Hiti), installed by Priyavarmana, was also discovered within the northern grounds, linking the site to the ancient settlement\u2019s water management system.\nThe temple has enjoyed royal patronage and remains integral to local Newar clans such as the Pradhans, Mallas, Pradhanagas, Shresthas, Manandhars, and Rajbhansis, who venerate the goddess as their lineage deity.

Surprised, Surya dug at the spot and uncovered a divine light, revealing a Shiva Linga, which is now enshrined at the temple.\nThe Bhasa Vamshavali traces the origin of Pashupati to the Dwapar Yuga, linking it to the Pandavas.

The gods, concerned by his disappearance, searched for him and found the mystical deer grazing by the Bagmati River. Suspecting it was Shiva, they caught its horn. In a tug-of-war, the horn broke, and Shiva vanished, returning to Kailash. The broken horn was later enshrined as a Shiva idol, according to another legend.

The eight-petalled stone mandala, symbolizing the Shri Yantra, represents its main deity, Rajarajeshwari.\nAccording to local belief, Rajarajeshwari has an interesting origin story associated with Bhaktapur. It is said that she expressed a desire to leave Bhaktapur and explore the world beyond. However, the priest of the temple agreed to her request on the condition that she must return before sunrise. If she failed to do so, she would be bound to stay wherever she was at that moment. Unfortunately, Rajarajeshwari  was unable to make it back to Bhaktapur before sunrise. As a result, she had to remain in the Pashupati area.\nThe temple features intricate gilded details added by Jitajanga Rana in the 19th century. Rituals, including daily worship by Karmacharya priests and annual NavaDurga mask dances, connect the site to Bhaktapur\u2019s traditions. (NHDP, n.d.)",

Comprising a series of paved platforms leading to the river, it is home to significant shrines, including Gangamai and Virupaksha, near the eastern stairway. In Hinduism, the Bagmati River near Pashupatinath Temple is considered like the sacred Vaitarani River. Crossing it symbolizes the soul\u2019s journey to liberation after death. The river represents purification and the transition from the physical world to spiritual freedom. Cremation by the Bagmati is believed to cleanse sins and help the soul reach moksha (liberation).Cremation rituals, performed 24/7, follow Hindu traditions where the deceased\u2019s elements\u2014fire, water, air, earth, and sky\u2014are returned to their respective realms. The procession, known as Malami, features rhythmic music or conch blowing, signaling the passing. This sacred site symbolizes the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, with its deep spiritual significance attracting both locals and visitors. (Jenkins et al., 2006)",

Recognized as one of Nepal's 64 major Shivalingas, it is revered for fulfilling wishes and absolving sins. The temple's courtyard houses smaller Shivalingas, a Nandi statue, and a Trishul. Religious texts and local legends connect it to Arjuna from the Mahabharat and the Kirat community.In the Mahabharat, Arjuna, seeking divine guidance to enhance his archery skills before the Kurukshetra War, meditated in the Shleshmantaka jungle. Lord Shiva, disguised as a Kirat (hunter), appeared to test him. They both shot arrows at a boar, and after a dispute over who shot first, Arjuna realized the Kirat was Shiva. Impressed by Arjuna's humility, Shiva granted him the P\u0101\u015bupat\u0101stra, a powerful weapon for the upcoming war. Rituals like Bala Chaturdashi and Shivaratri draw devotees, while conservation efforts by figures like Purnachandra Maharaja ensure its legacy. It remains a vital spiritual hub for worship and cultural events. (NHDP, n.d.)",

    "history": "Boudha Stupa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a blend of Newar, Tamang, Sherpa, and Tibetan cultures, making it a unique symbol of the rich cultural and spiritual diversity of the Kathmandu Valley. Located in the northeastern part of Kathmandu, this massive stupa is one of the largest in the world and serves as a major pilgrimage site for Buddhists from different traditions. The stupa's grand dome, adorned with the Buddha's all-seeing eyes, reflects the region's deep Buddhist heritage. Surrounding the stupa are numerous monasteries, shrines, and shops, creating a lively atmosphere where local traditions and rituals thrive. The area is especially significant during major Buddhist festivals like Buddha Jayanti and the Boudha Stupa Jatra, when devotees from diverse communities come together to celebrate and perform rituals. The cultural richness of Boudha makes it not only a religious hub but also a cultural crossroads, offering visitors a glimpse into the harmonious blending of various Buddhist traditions.\nHistory\nBoudha Stupa is one of the largest and most significant Buddhist sites in Nepal. Its origin remains unclear, with various historical sources offering different accounts. According to Nepalese records, the stupa was constructed during the Licchavi period. Gopal Raj Vansavali, a historical chronicle, credits King Shiva Dev with the construction of the stupa, while Mary Slusser suggests that King Mandeva may have been involved in its initial erection, with Shiva Dev later renovating it. Tibetan sources associate Boudha with King Songtsen Gampo, who is believed to have initiated the establishment of Buddhist temples, including the one at Boudha. After the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959, Boudha became a key center for Tibetan exiles, significantly contributing to its religious and cultural development.\n\nLegends of Boudha Stupa\n1. Kathmandu Legend: A prominent legend associated with the Boudha Stupa originates from Kathmandu during the Licchavi period. According to the story, King Dharmadev constructed a stone spout near his palace, but it mysteriously dried up, causing a severe drought in the kingdom. Distressed, the king consulted astrologers, who advised him to perform a human sacrifice to bring an end to the drought. They instructed the king to sacrifice someone who possessed all thirty-two virtues, a rare attribute. After an extensive search, it was discovered that only the king and his son, Manadeva, possessed these virtues.\nReluctant to sacrifice his son, the king decided to offer his own life and instructed Manadeva to decapitate a hooded stranger at the stone spout the next morning. However, when Manadeva returned to the palace, he realized, to his horror, that he had unwittingly killed his father. Filled with grief and guilt, Manadeva renounced the throne and chose to live a life of seclusion.\nAs time passed, the kingdom continued to suffer from the drought. In his despair, Manadeva had a vision in which Vajra Yogini appeared to him, instructing him to release a bird and build a stupa at the spot where the bird landed. Following this vision, Manadeva released a bird, and it landed at the site of what would become the Boudha Stupa. The construction of the stupa was difficult due to a lack of water to mix the clay. However, the laborers ingeniously collected dew using large sheets of cloth, which allowed them to complete the stupa. The use of dew, known as \"khasu ti\" in Nepal Bhasa, led to the stupa being named Khasu Ti Chaitya, a name that later evolved into Khasti Chaitya.\n2. Tibetan Legend: A different, yet equally significant, legend comes from Tibetan Buddhism. According to this account, Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, had vowed to release all sentient beings from suffering. After years of efforts, Avalokitesvara looked down from his palace, only to find that many beings continued to suffer, despite his best efforts. Overcome by despair, Avalokitesvara wept, and his tears fell to the ground. These teardrops were believed to have transformed into the daughters of Indra, the king of the gods.\nOne of these daughters, Apurna, was born as a human named Jadzima, into a humble family. As she grew up, Jadzima worked hard to support her children and eventually saved enough money to fulfill a noble aspiration\u2014to build a grand stupa that would help alleviate suffering. Despite opposition from the local nobility, who were jealous of her plans, the king granted her permission to build the stupa. The stupa came to be known as \"Jharung Khasor,\" meaning \"permission to build,\" symbolizing the king\u2019s approval despite the resistance from the powerful elites. This stupa, built with the intention to end suffering, continues to serve as a significant religious and cultural landmark.",

    "name": "Swoyambhu Mahachaitya",
    "location": "Kathmandu",
    "history": "The Swoyambhu Stupa is situated to the northwest of Kathmandu, atop a green hill known by various names: 'Gau Puche Parbat', 'Padmagiri' and 'Vajrakutta Parbat'. Nearby is Manjushree Hill, also referred to as 'Gau Singhe Parbat'. These hills are named 'Gau Singhe' and 'Gau Puche' because, from Nagarjun Hill, their shapes resemble a cow. Manjushree Hill appears as a cow's horn, while Swoyambhu Hill resembles the cow's tail.\nThe Swoyambhu Stupa, estimated to be over 1,500 years old, is a highly revered landmark in the Kathmandu Valley. The term 'Swoyambhu' in Nepal Bhasa translates to 'self-sprung' or 'self-manifested'. The most common route to the summit involves climbing 365 steps from the front entrance. Alternatively, the rear entrance, accessible by car or scooter, requires only a few steps to reach the top. The site\u2019s integration of Hindu and Buddhist elements creates a distinctive and harmonious fusion of traditions that is seldom encountered elsewhere. (Buddhacharya, A. M. (2024, June 13). Insights on Swoyambhu Stupa [Interview with a local cultural expert].)\n\u25cf Mythology of Swoyambhu\nAccording to the Swoyambhu Purana, the Kathmandu Valley was once a vast and beautiful lake. When Vipaswi Buddha arrived, he planted a lotus seed at the site where the Swoyambhu Stupa now stands. The seed grew into a magnificent lotus with a thousand petals, its radiant light was visible from afar and drawing many pilgrims. Due to its luminous quality, the site came to be known as Jyoti Chaitya or Ratna Chaitya.\nImpressed by the divine light of the lotus, Manjushri believed that draining the lake would make the site more accessible to human pilgrims. Using his great sword, he carved a gorge in the surrounding mountains, allowing the water to drain and revealing the valley that is now Kathmandu. As the lake dried up, the lotus emerged on the hill, which eventually became the location of the Swoyambhu Stupa.\nMany years later, Shantikaracharya, who came to Nepal on pilgrimage, recognized the need to preserve this sacred light. To honor and protect the spot where the lotus had once bloomed, he is believed to have constructed the stupa. (Buddhacharya, A. M. (2024, June 13). Insights on Swoyambhu Stupa [Interview with a local cultural expert].)\n\u25cf History of Swoyambhu\nAccording to the Gopal Raj Vamsavali, a 14th-century manuscript from Nepal, the Swoyambhu Stupa was established by King Vrsadeva, the great-grandfather of King Manadeva (464\u2013505 CE), during the Licchavi period in the early 5th century CE. This is supported by a damaged stone inscription at the site, which records that King Manadeva commissioned further work in 640 CE. Additionally, Emperor Ashoka is believed to have visited the site in the 3rd century BCE and constructed an early temple, which subsequently fell into disrepair for reasons that remain unknown. In 1349, during the first Muslim invasion of Kathmandu, the Swoyambhu Stupa was completely destroyed. It was subsequently repaired. Following the construction of the main stupa, additional monuments were added over time by various dynasties. The eastern stairway was built in the 17th century by King Pratap Malla, a prominent ruler of Kathmandu. (Vredeveld, n.d.)\nIn 1918 CE, with authorization from the Nepalese government, the 14th major renovation of Sri Swoyambhu Mahachaitya was undertaken. This restoration involved replacing the harmika and repairing the 13 bronze disks. The work was completed over a period of three years, finishing in 1921 CE. (Tuladhar, 2021)\nThe 15th renovation of Sri Swoyambhu MahaChaitya occurred between 2008 and 2010, resembling a massive jigsaw puzzle. Over 30,000 pieces were carefully removed, repaired, cleaned, and reassembled using more than 100,000 nails. Additionally, all the metal plates received a fresh layer of gold, utilizing 20 kg of the precious metal is one of the largest gold restoration projects ever undertaken. (Parashar, 2010)\n\n\u25cf Buddhacharya Family\nThe Buddhacharya family descends from four legendary brothers tasked with preserving the traditions, norms, and values of Swoyambhu, as designated by Shantikar Acharya. The community is divided into four lineages\u2014referred to as \"KA: WA:\"\u2014which trace their roots back to these brothers, who established the clan centuries ago. Together, these lineages encompass 30 families, each representing the legacy of one of the four brothers. Each group has its own leader, guiding their members in honoring their shared heritage. (Buddhacharya et al., 2019)",
